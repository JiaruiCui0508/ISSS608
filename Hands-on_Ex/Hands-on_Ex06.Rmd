```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

In this Hands-on Exercise, the following R packages will be used:
sf, an R package specially designed to handle geospatial data in simple feature objects.

```{r}
packages = c('lubridate', 'tidyverse', 'readr',
             'tmap','sf','sftime','clock','rmarkdown')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}
```

In the code chunk below, read_sf() of sf package is used to parse School.csv into R as an sf data.frame and parses Pubs.csv, Apartments.csv, Buildings.csv, Employer.csv, and Restaurants.csv into R

```{r}
schools <- read_sf("data/wkt/Schools.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
buildings <- read_sf("data/wkt/Buildings.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
apartments <- read_sf("data/wkt/Apartments.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
employers <- read_sf("data/wkt/Employers.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
pubs <- read_sf("data/wkt/Pubs.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
restaurants <- read_sf("data/wkt/Restaurants.csv", 
                   options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=location")
```

After importing the data file into R, it is important for us to review the data object.

```{r}
print(buildings)
```

The code chunk below plots the building polygon features by using tm_polygon().

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(buildings)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1)
tmap_mode("plot")
```


The code chunk below is used to plot a composite map by combining the buildings and employers simple feature data.frames.

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot") # the sequence is important - depends on the layers
tm_shape(buildings)+ # read to get the data
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(employers) +
  tm_dots(col = "red")
```

# Importing wkt data

```{r eval = FALSE}
logs <- read_sf("data/wkt/ParticipantStatusLogs1.csv", 
                options = "GEOM_POSSIBLE_NAMES=currentLocation")
```

# Processing movement data
To process the movement data, the following steps will be performed:

convert timestamp field from character data type to date-time data type by using date_time_parse() of clock package.
derive a day field by using get_day() of clock package.
extract records whereby currentMode field is equal to Transport class by using filter() of dplyr package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
logs_selected <- logs %>%
  mutate(Timestamp = date_time_parse(timestamp,
                                     zone = "",
                                     format = "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S")) %>%
  mutate(day = get_day(Timestamp))%>%
  filter(currentMode == "Transport")
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
write_rds(logs_selected,"data/rds/logs_selected.rds")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
logs_selected <- read_rds('data/rds/logs_selected.rds')
```

In the code chunk below, st_make_grid() of sf package is used to create haxegons

```{r}
hex <- st_make_grid(buildings, 
                    cellsize=100, 
                    square=FALSE) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  rowid_to_column('hex_id')
plot(hex)
```

The code chunk below perform point in polygon overlay by using [st_join()] of sf package.

```{r}
points_in_hex <- st_join(logs_selected, 
                         hex, 
                         join=st_within)
#plot(points_in_hex, pch='.')
```


In the code chunk below, st_join() of sf package is used to count the number of event points in the hexagons.

```{r}
points_in_hex <- st_join(logs_selected, 
                        hex, 
                        join=st_within) %>%
  st_set_geometry(NULL) %>%
  count(name='pointCount', hex_id)
head(points_in_hex)
```

In the code chunk below, left_join() of dplyr package is used to perform a left-join by using hex as the target table and points_in_hex as the join table. The join ID is hex_id.

```{r}
hex_combined <- hex %>%
  left_join(points_in_hex, 
            by = 'hex_id') %>%
  replace(is.na(.), 0)
```

In the code chunk below, tmap package is used to create the hexagon binning map.

```{r}
tm_shape(hex_combined %>%
           filter(pointCount > 0))+
  tm_fill("pointCount",
          n = 8,
          style = "quantile") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.1)
```

Code chunk below joins the event points into movement paths by using the participants' IDs as unique identifiers.

```{r}
logs_path <- logs_selected %>%
  group_by(participantId, day) %>%
  summarize(m = mean(Timestamp), 
            do_union=FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")
print(logs_path)
```

```{r}
logs_path_selected <- logs_path %>%
  filter(participantId==4)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(buildings)+
tm_polygons(col = "grey60",
           size = 1,
           border.col = "black",
           border.lwd = 1) +
  tm_shape(logs_path_selected)+
  tm_lines(col = "blue")
tmap_mode("plot")
```
