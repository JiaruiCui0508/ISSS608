# Getting Started

## Setting up R packages

To start with, [ggstatsplot](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/index.html) and tidyverse packages will be launched using library().

```{r}
packages = c('ggstatsplot', 'tidyverse','rstantools')
for (p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
}
```

## Importing Data

In this exercise, the Exam.csv data will be used.

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## Working with ggstatsplot

### ANOVA Test


In the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=8}
set.seed(1234)
ggbetweenstats(
  data = exam,
  x = RACE, 
  y = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes"
)
```
